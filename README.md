> Get started with Python for streaming analytics

Set yourself up for productivity and collaboration.
We assume no prior programming experience and that you want to 
get productive as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10 or higher
1. VS Code
1. VS Code Extension: Python
1. Git (configured)

Remember:

- **Spacing, Spelling, Capitalization**: With computers, these are critical. Always double-check!

## Verify Installations / Update Default Python

In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal).
If macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` in the commands below.

```shell
git --version
python --version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

## Execute Utility Script (Diagnostics)

With your repo folder open in VS Code:

```shell
python util_about.py
```
---


## Explore & Execute Project Scripts

## Update Edit README

Edit this README.md file. It uses Markdown, a simple and easy markup language.

- Keep the prerequisites and task headings. 
- Within the task headings, keep only the commands that worked on YOUR machine. 
- Remove unnecessary instructions once you've mastered them.
- Add any additional notes that will help you in the future.

## Sync to GitHub

### Option A: Use VS Code (Easy!)

### Option B: Use Git Bash or Terminal Commands (Easy as well):

Open a new `Git Bash` or Terminal window. Run the following commands one at a time.
They will first add all the files (add "dot"). 
Then they will commit the changes with a message. 
Finally, they will push the changes up to GitHub.

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial results"
git push origin main
```
